## description

***
As a user, I want to be able to view create and track daily workouts. I want to be able to log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day. I should also be able to track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise. If the exercise is a cardio exercise, I should be able to track my distance traveled.<br>
Workout Tracker answers these needs and presents an easy to use UI to keep track of daily physical exercises with graphs. This app utilizes Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, Mongoose and Bootstrap. It was developed over front end starter code and deployed to Heroku through MongoDB Atlas.
